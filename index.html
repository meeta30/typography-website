What is typography?

Typography is the technique of structuring letters and words in a way that improves the legibility, readability and even navigation of a website. It helps create an aesthetically pleasing interface for users and in short, it gives life to the text.

All these elements are important since they provide a pleasant reading experience for users, often making the difference between users taking an action on your website or dropping off.

Each text you read on a screen utilizes a typeface that influences the ambience, tone and visual layout of a site. There are some misunderstandings about the difference between typefaces and fonts, with many people using the terms interchangeably.
