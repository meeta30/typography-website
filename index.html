                        Science has no single origin. Rather, systematic methods emerged gradually over the course of
                        tens of thousands of years,[5][4] taking different forms around the world, and few details are
                        known about the very earliest developments.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science">Read

                    <h3>
                        Classical antiquity
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        In classical antiquity, there is no real ancient analog of a modern scientist. Instead,
                        well-educated, usually upper-class, and almost universally male individuals performed various
                        investigations into nature whenever they could afford the time.[53] Before the invention or
                        discovery of the concept of phusis or nature by the pre-Socratic philosophers, the same words
                        tend to be used to describe the natural "way" in which a plant grows,[54] and the "way" in
                        which, for example, one tribe worships a particular god. For this reason, it is claimed that
                        these men were the first philosophers in the strict sense and the first to clearly distinguish
                        "nature" and "convention".[55]

                        Due to the collapse of the Western Roman Empire, the 5th century saw an intellectual decline and
                        knowledge of Greek conceptions of the world deteriorated in Western Europe.<a
